[1mSYNOPSIS[0m

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       This tool converts CSV data to Excel-2007+. It can convert the CSV into
       a single sheet, merge CSV files into multiple sheets in a workbook or
       split a single CSV into multiple sheets.

       The tool supports encoding, formula handle, date conversion and some
       more.

[1mOPTIONS[0m
       -s S
       --sep=S
         use "S" as separator character, auto-detect, default = ",".

         The literal string "tab" is allowed.

       -q Q
       --quo=Q
         use "Q" as quotation character, auto-detect, default = """.

         The literal string "undef" is allowed to disable quotation.

       -e E
       --esc=E
         use "E" as escape character, auto-detect, default = """.

         The literal string "undef" is allowed to disable escapes.

       -w W
       --width=W
         Set column width. Default is to auto-size per column per sheet with a
         minimum width of 4.

       -o FILE.xlsx
       -x FILE.xlsx
       --out=FILE.xlsx
         Specify the output filename. Default it the same name as the input-
         file where the trailing ".csv" will be replaced with ".xlsx".

         If a filename can not be automatically generated, it will default to
         "csv2xlsx.xlsx".

       -d format
       --date-fmt=format
         Use "format" as date formats. Default = "dd-mm-yyyy".

       -D range
       --date-col=range
         Only convert dates in columns "range". Default is everywhere.

         Ranges are numeric, where the first column has index 1. A range is a
         definition of sections joined by ","s. A section is either a single
         column or a start/finish-pair joined with a dash. A missing finish
         index on the last segment is an open range (till the end of the
         line).

         If the range is 0, date conversion is disabled.

          -D 0
          -D 1,2,6
          -D 2,4-8,12-

       -C format
       --curr-fmt=format
         Use "format" as currency formats for currency <C>, no default.

          -C '$:### ### ##0.00'

       -f
       --force
         Force usage of the output file if it already exists (unlink before
         use).

       -F
       --formulas
         Allow formula's. Otherwise fields starting with an equal sign "=" are
         forced to string type.

         There are several shortcuts here to specify different behavior:

         --Fa=a
           Define formula action: "none"/"die"/"croak"/"diag"/"empty"/"undef"

         --Ft
           Formula's will be stored as text (formula actions: none)

         --Fd
           Formula's will cause a die

         --Fc
           Formula's will cause a croak

         --FD
           Formula's will cause a warning (this is the default)

         --Fe
           Formula's will be replaced by the empty string

         --Fu
           Formula's will be replaced with an undefined cell

       -u
       --utf-8
       --utf8
         CSV is UTF-8 encoded. Likely not needed, as most is auto-detected.

       --de
       --fix-utf8
         Attempt to fix double-encoded UTF-8. e.g. "\x{00c3}\x{00ab}" should
         have been "\x0100}". YMMV.

       -m
       --merge
         Merge multiple CSV's into a single Excel (separate sheets).

         With this option, the option "-o" is required. All arguments should
         be existing files. Piping is not supported.

       -L N
       --row-limit=N
         Limit export to "N" rows.

       -S CxP
       --split=CxP
         When dealing with big CSV datasets, it this option enables you to
         split the data over several sheets. When all the "-S" options match
         is a single row, that row will be the first row of a new sheet. (see
         also "--sl=C")

         C The column that should be examined. "A" = 1. If lower case, the
           value of that column is matched case insensitive when appropriate.

            -S 7=ab      Column G is literal "ab"
            -S G=ab      Column G is literal "ab"
            -S g=ab      Column G is literal "ab", or "aB", or "Ab", or "AB"

         x Defines the operation on the column

           = Literal match

              -S G=ab      Column G is literal "ab"
              -S g=ab      Column G is literal "ab", or "aB", or "Ab", or "AB"

           / Regex match

              -S G/b[a-z]  Column G matches /b[a-z]/
              -S g/b[a-z]  Column G matches /b[a-z]/i

           u U
             Check for defined

              -S Gu        Column G is undefined
              -S GU        Column G is defined

             Similar for emptiness

              -S G=        Column G is defined but empty
              -S G/.       Column G is defined and not empty

           < >
             Compare. If the value in the column is defined compare. If the
             values only holds digits, do a numeric compare, otherwise do a
             string compare.

              -S G<42      Column G is defined and less than 42 (numeric)
              -S G<ab      Column G is defined and less than 42 (string)

              -S G>42      Column G is defined and greater than 42 (numeric)
              -S G>ab      Column G is defined and greater than 42 (string)

         P pattern or literal string. Quotation might be required differing
           per OS and shell-environment.

       --sl=C
         When splitting with "-S" / "--split", if all criteria match and a new
         sheet is to be created, use the value in column "C" of the matching
         row as new sheet label.

       -v [V]
       --verbose[=V]
         Set verbosity level. Default = 1. No argument will set to 2.
