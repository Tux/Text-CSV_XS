It's the inconsistency of csv (in => ..., out => ...);

                       | in
                       +---------------------------------------------------------------
                       | Data Structure | Sub   | File Name            | File Handle
----+------------------+----------------+-------+----------------------+---------------
out | [Absent]         | Works          | Works | Works                | Works
    | Undefined Scalar | Works          | Works | Run-time error       | Run-time error
    | File Name        | Works          | Works | Instructs programmer | Run-time error
    | File Handle      | Works          | Works | Run-time error       | Run-time error

The instruction to the programmer is doubly weird because it could simply do what it would do if the programmer used the suggested code.

  The function csv () is streaming!

You can encode as a stream.
You can decode as a stream.

But you can't transform as a stream. The inner call (csv (in => "a.csv, ...)) loads the entire file into memory.
