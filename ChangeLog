    * Removed prototypes
    * Added a SPECIFICATION section to the pod
    * Safe caching of eol, and a warning in the docs
    * Rewrote t/20_file.t do do actual file IO instead of IO_Scalar fake
    * Small optimization for parse (juerd)
    * Added make target test_speed
    * Merged the items from CAVEAT to SPECIFICATION
    * Updated the TODO and Release Plan sections
    * Speed up internals by using references instead of copies (juerd)
    * Reworked error_input, which also had an undetected internal error
    * Added IO tests for lexical IO handles and perlio IO to/from scalars

0.28	- 2007-06-03, H.Merijn Brand
    * IMPORTANT CHANGE: new () returns undef if it gets unsupported
      attributes. Until now, new ({ esc_char => "\\" }) was just
      silently ignored. Rejecting it and failing is better than
      continuing with false assumptions.
    * Added allow_loose_quotes  (see doc)
    * Added t/65_allow.t
    * Added allow_loose_escapes (see doc) (RT#15076)
    * More code cleanup in XS
    * Added allow_whitespace    (see doc)

0.27	- 2007-05-31, H.Merijn Brand

0.26	- 2007-05-15, H.Merijn Brand
    * Add $csv->allow_undef (1) suggestion in TODO
      Still have to find the best spot to document
      the difference between empty string and undef
    * Spell-checked the pod and fixed some typo's
    * Added t/70_rt.t
      - Regression         for RT#24386: \t doesn't work (WFM)
      - Regression and fix for RT#21530: getline () return at eof
	This one still passes under perl 5.00504
      - Regression         for RT#18703: Fails to use quote_char of '~'
    * Added t/55_combi.t for most combinations of always_quote,
      sep_char, quote_char, and escape_char
    * Added docs about sep_char not allowed to be either quote_char
      or escape_char
    * Both combine () and parse () now return FALSE id sep_char is
      equal to either quote_char or escape_char. Done in XS, as it
      was a slowdown of 10% when done in perl.

0.25	- 2007-05-07, H.Merijn Brand
    # Merijn got the maintainership

      except for the ->{types} and ->{_types}
    * Moved test.pl to examples/speed.pl

0.23	- 2001-10-10, Jochen Wiedmann  <joe@ispsoft.de>
    * Changed "char" to "unsigned char" in CSV_XS.xs.
      Matthew Graham <MGraham@pacificaccess.com.au>

0.22	- 2000-12-22, Jochen Wiedmann  <joe@ispsoft.de>
    * CSV_XS.xs: Added the handling of escape characters
      outside of quotes. Kirill Paliy <kpaliy@aaanet.ru>

0.21	- 2000-08-18, Jochen Wiedmann  <joe@ispsoft.de>
    * CSV_XS.pm (parse): Minor bugfix in the parse method.
      Norikatsu Shigemura (nork@cityfujisawa.ne.jp)

0.20	- 1999-06-28, Jochen Wiedmann  <joe@ispsoft.de>
    * CSV_XS.xs: Fixed a bug in the decoder where escapeChar wasn't
      handled right. Pavel Kotala <pkotala@logis.cz>

0.19	- 1999-05-01, Jochen Wiedmann  <joe@ispsoft.de>

      (Ken Williams <kwilliam@DigitalRiver.com>)
    * The types method is now implemented in Perl.

0.16	- 1999-02-11, Jochen Wiedmann  <joe@ispsoft.de>
    * CSV_XS.pm: PV, IV and NV are no longer exportable, so that I
      need not inherit from Exporter any longer. (This caused trying
      to autoload DESTROY without any reason. Seems to me to be a
      serious performance penalty.)
    * CSV_XS.pm: Being a little bit less strict now: If quoteChar and
      escapeChar are different, then the quote char may be part of
      the field. (Not at the fields start, of course.)

0.15	- 1998-08-21, Jochen Wiedmann  <joe@ispsoft.de>
    * CSV_XS.pm: Moved print () and getline () to XS.

    * Added $csv->{eol}

    * Added $csv->{quote_char} = undef

0.10	- 1998-05-05, Jochen Wiedmann  <joe@ispsoft.de>
    * Moved encoding and decoding to XS; added binary mode; added
      print () and getline () methods.

1998-06-05  Alan Citterman  <alan@mfgrtl.com>
    * Initial version
