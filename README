Module:
    Text::CSV_XS

Description:
    Text::CSV_XS provides facilities for the composition and decomposition of
    comma-separated values.  An instance of the Text::CSV_XS class can combine
    fields into a CSV string and parse a CSV string into fields.

Prerequisites:
    perl 5.005_03. 5.005 will not be able to build the manual pages.
    examples require 5.006, but are probably easy to mold into 5.005
    examples/csv-check requires perl with defined-or and PerlIO, and
    making that work on other versions is left as an exercise to the
    reader.

Build/Installation:
    Standard build/installation:
	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install
    (The 'make' step cannot be omitted for perl-5.005)

    Interface design by Alan Citterman <alan@mfgrtl.com>

    A pure-perl version is being maintained by Makamaka Hannyaharamitu
    as Text::CSV_PP, which tries to follow Text::CSV_XS very closely.

    Text::CSV_PP is bundled in Text::CSV, which now is a wrapper module over
    Text::CSV_XS and Text::CSV_PP that will select Text::CSV_XS if available,
    and otherwise use Text::PP.
