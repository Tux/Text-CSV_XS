Module:
    Text::CSV_XS

Description:
    Text::CSV_XS provides facilities for the composition and decomposition
    of comma-separated values.   An instance of the Text::CSV_XS class can
    combine fields into a CSV string and parse a CSV string into fields.

Prerequisites:
    perl 5.6.1 or up.

    You can have a working Test::More for 5.6.1 by requiring version
    Test::Harness-2.64 and Test::Simple-0.90

    I found no easy way to get Test::More working on 5.6.0

    examples/csv-check requires perl with defined-or and PerlIO, and
    making that work on other versions is left as an exercise to the
    reader. Other examples are checked against 5.8.4. For Unicode to
    work more or less reliable, you'd need perl 5.8.2 or newer.

    examples/csv2xlsx requires 5.14 or newer.

Build/Installation:
    Standard build/installation:
	perl Makefile.PL
	make test
	make install

    A pure-perl version Text::CSV_PP is being maintained by  Kenichi
    Ishigaki. This module was created by Makamaka Hannyaharamitu who
    maintained it up to 2015.   It tries to follow  Text::CSV_XS  as
    closely as possible.
    Do not file bugs on Text::CSV to Text::CSV_XS.

    Text::CSV_PP is bundled with Text::CSV which is a wrapper module
    over Text::CSV_XS and Text::CSV_PP that selects  Text::CSV_XS if
    if available, and otherwise uses Text::CSV_PP.
