Module:
    Text::CSV_XS

Description:
    Text::CSV_XS provides facilities for the composition and decomposition
    of comma-separated values.   An instance of the Text::CSV_XS class can
    combine fields into a CSV string and parse a CSV string into fields.

    Program to process a CSV file:
    ------------------------------
    This distribution provides several examples of scripts that convert CSV
    files or data streams into XLS or XLSX  or simply check if the CSV data
    is valid. It is easy to amend those scripts to do whatever the end-user
    actually requires.  The full documentation also provides various small
    snippets of example code.

    Convert a CSV file into JSON:
    -----------------------------
    That process is described in the documentation.

Prerequisites:
    perl 5.6.1 or up.

    You can have a working Test::More for 5.6.1 by requiring version
    Test::Harness-2.64 and Test::Simple-0.90

    I found no easy way to get Test::More working on 5.6.0

    examples/csv-check requires perl with defined-or and PerlIO, and
    making that work on other versions is left as an exercise to the
    reader. Other examples are checked against 5.8.4. For Unicode to
    work more or less reliable, you'd need perl 5.8.2 or newer.

    examples/csv2xlsx requires 5.14 or newer.

Build/Installation:
    Standard build/installation:
	perl Makefile.PL
	make test
	make install

    A pure-perl version Text::CSV_PP is being maintained by  Kenichi
    Ishigaki. This module was created by Makamaka Hannyaharamitu who
    maintained it up to 2015.   It tries to follow  Text::CSV_XS  as
    closely as possible.
    Do not file bugs on Text::CSV to Text::CSV_XS.

    Text::CSV_PP is bundled with Text::CSV which is a wrapper module
    over Text::CSV_XS and Text::CSV_PP that selects  Text::CSV_XS if
    if available, and otherwise uses Text::CSV_PP.
